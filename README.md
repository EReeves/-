Pinyin 拼音

A Pinyin writing utility for linux.

Will eventually convert Pinyin to Chinese characters.


Requires mono, xsel and xdotool

**Build/Install**

build, cd to bin, install with sudo ./install.sh

You will need to bind your own shortcuts, how you do this depends on the distribution but usually it's under your keyboard settings.

For converting a vowel to pinyin.
bind "snipyin.sh vowel"

For converting pinyin to chinese characters.
bind "snipyin.sh"

**Usage**

Diacritics can be added to vowels by typing the tone number and then pressing your vowel shortcut.

e.g. "ni3" turns in to nǐ

You can then convert the Pinyin to Chinese characters by hitting your other shortcut.

e.g. hǎo turns in to 好
